MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition 

This project is a demonstration of handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a popular dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image being a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.
